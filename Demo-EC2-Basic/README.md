# EC2 Basic Features Demo

This repository demonstrates core AWS EC2 functionalities, showcasing my proficiency with essential EC2 operations. It highlights a range of fundamental tasks, including launching instances, modifying instance types, managing snapshots and custom AMIs, recovering access when key pairs are lost, and archiving EBS volumes.
  
## üåç Overview

- This demo covers:
    - **Launching and connecting** to EC2 instances running Linux and Windows Server 2022 Base.
    - **Modifying the EC2 instance type** to meet different performance requirements.
    - **Creating EC2 snapshots** for backup and recovery purposes.
    - **Building custom AMIs** from configured instances.
    - **Launching new instances** from custom AMIs for repeatable deployments.
    - **Access recovery methods** for Windows instances using **AWS Systems Manager (SSM)** when the key pair is lost.
    - **Access recovery methods** for Linux instances using **User Data** when the key pair is unavailable.
    - **Archiving EBS volumes** through snapshot creation.

- This demo serves as a practical illustration of essential EC2 operations in a real-world environment.
