# AWS Lab Workshops

Welcome to my repository showcasing the hands-on labs and workshops I have completed as part of my study and practice in AWS. This repository contains various exercises, projects, and scripts demonstrating my skills and knowledge gained from practical AWS training.

## Overview

In this repository, you will find:

- **Lab Exercises**: Step-by-step walkthroughs and solutions for AWS labs, such as setting up EC2 instances, creating VPCs, working with IAM, and more.
- **Projects**: Full-stack projects utilizing multiple AWS services, demonstrating real-world use cases and deployment strategies.
- **Scripts**: Automation scripts written using AWS CLI, Terraform, and other tools for provisioning and managing resources in AWS.
  
The labs are part of my journey to becoming proficient in AWS, DevOps, and Cloud Engineering.
