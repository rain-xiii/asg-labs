# AWS Practical Solutions & Deployments

Welcome to my repository on AWS Practical Solutions & Deployments. This repository showcases real-world AWS implementations, covering various architectures, configurations, and automation techniques. It includes practical exercises, deployment strategies, and troubleshooting insights that demonstrate my hands-on experience and problem-solving skills in AWS environments.

## Disclaimer
This repository is not intended to be a step-by-step tutorial for practical exercises. Instead, it serves as a summary and explanation of the ideas, concepts, and solutions used in building the model and addressing related issues. The content here aims to communicate the general approach rather than provide a detailed guide.



## Overview

In this repository, you will find:

- **AWS Implementations**: This section summarizes various AWS tasks and solutions, such as setting up EC2 instances, configuring VPCs, managing IAM, and more. It emphasizes the general approach and concepts involved, showcasing how I apply AWS tools and services to solve real-world problems.

- **Projects**: In this section, you'll find full-stack projects that utilize multiple AWS services. These projects demonstrate real-world use cases and deployment strategies, highlighting the key concepts and solutions used. Detailed instructions for setup are not included.

- **Scripts**: Automation scripts written using AWS CLI, Terraform, and other tools for provisioning and managing resources in AWS.
  
These implementations and projects reflect my ongoing journey to mastering AWS, DevOps, and Cloud Engineering through practical application and hands-on experience.

## Structure

The repository is organized by topics and hands-on sessions:


```bash
.
│── README.md 
│── VPN-Site-to-Site/
│── Set-up-Hybrid-DNS/ 
```

Each folder contains:

- A **README.md** file with detailed instructions and explanations for the hands-on sessions.
- **Implementation-details.md** which provides an overview of the necessary AWS resources and configurations used in the implementation.
- **Troubleshooting.md** (optional) which outlines common issues encountered during the setup and provides solutions for resolving them.
- **Scripts** (optional) used to automate or configure AWS resources.
- Any **output** or **logs** from the implementation sessions.

## Hands-on Sessions

1. [**VPN Site-to-Site**](VPN-Site-to-Site/README.md)
2. [**Set up Hybrid DNS**](/Set-up-Hybrid-DNS/README.md)
3. [**Set up Transit Gateway**](/Set-up-AWS-Transit-Gateway/README.md)
4. [**VPC Peering**](/Set-up-VPC-Peering/README.md)
5. [**Demo EC2 basic**](/Demo-EC2-Basic/README.md)
6. [**Deploy an User Management Application on EC2**](/Deploy-an-User-Management-Application-on-EC2//README.md)

## Getting Started

To get started with these hands-on sessions, clone the repository and follow the individual instructions within each lab folder:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/rain-xiii/aws-devops-playbook.git
cd aws-devops-playbook
```

Each hands-on session has its own set of instructions for setup and execution.

## Prerequisites

Before starting, ensure you have the following:

- **AWS Account**: You need an active AWS account.
- **AWS CLI**: Installed and configured with your credentials.
- **Terraform** (optional for Infrastructure as Code labs): Installed and configured.
