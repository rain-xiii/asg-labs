# VPN Site-to-Site  

This section showcases my ability to configure and troubleshoot AWS Site-to-Site VPN, a secure and scalable solution for connecting on-premises networks to AWS or interconnecting multiple VPCs.

In this directory, I document the step-by-step process of setting up a Site-to-Site VPN, including:  
- Configuring **Customer Gateway** and **Virtual Private Gateway**  
- Setting up VPN Connections and Tunnels  
- Implementing **Route Propagation** in Route Tables  
- Security considerations and troubleshooting
