# Deploying a CRUD Application on Amazon Linux 2 with LAMP and Node.js
This repository demonstrates the deployment of a CRUD application on Amazon Linux 2 using a combined LAMP stack (Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP) and a Node.js environment. The project highlights key operations such as installing and configuring the LAMP web server, setting up phpMyAdmin for database management, configuring the database, installing Node.js, and deploying a sample CRUD application.

## üåç Overview ¬†
This project showcases the following components:

1. **LAMP Web Server Installation**: Setting up Apache, MySQL (MariaDB), and PHP on Amazon Linux 2.

2. **phpMyAdmin Installation**: Installing and configuring phpMyAdmin for convenient database management.

3. **Database Setup**: Creating and configuring a MySQL database for the CRUD application.

4. **Node.js Environment Installation**: Installing Node.js to support application deployment.

5. **Deploying the CRUD Application**: Integrating the LAMP and Node.js components to deploy a functional CRUD application.

## üéØ Goals ¬†

The objective of this project is to showcase the fundamental operations required to deploy a full-stack CRUD application on Amazon Linux 2 using both a LAMP stack and a Node.js environment. This demonstration includes installing and configuring Apache, MySQL, PHP, and phpMyAdmin, setting up the database, installing Node.js, and deploying a CRUD application. The goal is to illustrate how traditional LAMP components can be integrated with modern Node.js capabilities to build scalable and efficient web applications on AWS EC2.
