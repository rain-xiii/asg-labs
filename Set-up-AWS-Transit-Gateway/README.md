# Transit Gateway

AWS Transit Gateway is a scalable networking service that enables seamless communication between multiple VPCs, on-premises networks, and AWS Direct Connect or VPN connections. By centralizing routing through a single gateway, it simplifies network management, enhances security, and improves performance compared to traditional peering methods
  
## 🌍 Overview  
In this setup, we will:

- Deploy an **AWS Transit Gateway** to interconnect multiple VPCs.
- Configure **Transit Gateway Attachments** for VPCs, AWS Site-to-Site VPN, or Direct Connect.
- Define **Routing Tables** to control traffic flow between networks.

## 🎯 Goals  

The goal of this setup is to establish a centralized and scalable network architecture using AWS Transit Gateway, enabling seamless communication between multiple VPCs. This implementation aims to:

- **Simplify network management** by reducing the complexity of direct VPC peering connections.
- **Enhance scalability** by allowing multiple VPCs to connect through a single transit hub.
- **Improve routing efficiency** with a structured approach to traffic flow control.
- **Strengthen security** by defining clear routing policies and access controls within the Transit Gateway route tables.
